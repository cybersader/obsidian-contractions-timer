# Changelog

All notable changes to the Obsidian Contractions Timer plugin will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Show seconds on rest timer" setting**: Optional toggle to display seconds in the rest timer when over 1 hour (off by default).

### Fixed
- Cancel X button in time-ago picker now always red (forced over Obsidian defaults).
- "Had one" button height now matches the Start button.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Earlier..." custom time stepper**: "Had one" picker now includes an "Earlier..." option that opens an hour/minute stepper (up to 48h ago) for contractions missed long ago.
- **Skip button on rating pickers**: Post-contraction intensity/location pickers now have a "Skip" button and are visually grouped in a bordered card, making it clear they're optional and dismissible.

### Fixed
- Untimed contractions no longer trigger the regular intensity/location pickers (the untimed confirmation has its own inline intensity picker).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Had one" untimed picker**: Redesigned missed-contraction logging with a compact "Had one" button next to Start. Tap it to choose how long ago (Just now, ~5 min, ~15 min, ~30 min), then rate intensity. Replaces the old full-width untimed button.
- **Smart rest timer**: Rest display now switches from `M:SS` to `Xh Ym` after 1 hour and `Xd Yh` after 24 hours, so long gaps between contractions are readable at a glance.
- **Always-visible sections**: Pattern Assessment, Trend Analysis, and Hospital Advisor sections now always appear with a placeholder message when there isn't enough data, so you can see and reorder all sections from the start.
- **Untimed contractions in charts**: Wave chart shows untimed contractions as dashed markers with diamond tips instead of bell curves. History table shows "Untimed" in the duration column.
- Untimed contractions are excluded from duration-based stats (average duration, 5-1-1 duration check, stage estimation) but included in interval and count calculations.

### Fixed
- Location picker disappearing when intensity was set before location (both pickers now stay visible until both are rated).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Post-contraction picker bug: setting intensity before location caused location picker to vanish on re-render. Condition now checks both fields.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Untimed contraction logging (initial version, later redesigned in 0.1.6).
- Smart rest timer formatting.
