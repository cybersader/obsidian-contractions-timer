# Changelog

All notable changes to the Obsidian Contractions Timer plugin will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Intensity buttons (5-level scale) now wrap to two rows on mobile instead of cramming all five on one line with truncated text.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Show post-contraction rating" setting**: Master toggle (on by default) to disable intensity/location pickers entirely after stopping a contraction.
- Rating pickers now appear for untimed ("Had one") contractions too, not just timed ones.
- **Skip persists**: Clicking "Skip" on the rating card now marks that contraction as dismissed so pickers don't reappear on re-render. Previously, pickers would pop back up on every re-render until both intensity and location were set.

### Fixed
- Partial ratings (setting only intensity or only location) no longer cause pickers to nag forever. User can set one, click Skip, and move on. Analytics already handle partial data gracefully (need 3+ rated to compute trends).

## [0.1.12] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Intensity/location pickers now appear after stopping a contraction. Bug: `stopContraction()` cleared the local pause flag but not the persisted `data.paused`, so on re-render the widget re-entered paused state and dismissed the pickers before the user could interact with them. Same fix applied to `startContraction()`.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Pause overlay fully opaque on all themes/platforms (removed all semi-transparent rgba fallbacks and backdrop-filter that failed on mobile WebView).

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- "Had one" button constrained to max-width so Start button isn't crammed on mobile.
- "Log missed" subtitle hidden on narrow screens (<360px) for a more compact layout.
- Dark mode pause overlay now fully opaque (was 30% transparent, timer text bled through).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Mobile layout: compact "Had one" button, shorter Start button text ("Start #N") on narrow screens.
- Pause overlay now fully opaque so timer text doesn't bleed through on mobile.
- Section headers no longer truncate on narrow screens (smaller badge, tighter layout).
- Very narrow screens (<280px) stack button row vertically.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Show seconds on rest timer" setting**: Optional toggle to display seconds in the rest timer when over 1 hour (off by default).

### Fixed
- Cancel X button in time-ago picker now always red (forced over Obsidian defaults).
- "Had one" button height now matches the Start button.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Earlier..." custom time stepper**: "Had one" picker now includes an "Earlier..." option that opens an hour/minute stepper (up to 48h ago) for contractions missed long ago.
- **Skip button on rating pickers**: Post-contraction intensity/location pickers now have a "Skip" button and are visually grouped in a bordered card, making it clear they're optional and dismissible.

### Fixed
- Untimed contractions no longer trigger the regular intensity/location pickers (the untimed confirmation has its own inline intensity picker).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **"Had one" untimed picker**: Redesigned missed-contraction logging with a compact "Had one" button next to Start. Tap it to choose how long ago (Just now, ~5 min, ~15 min, ~30 min), then rate intensity. Replaces the old full-width untimed button.
- **Smart rest timer**: Rest display now switches from `M:SS` to `Xh Ym` after 1 hour and `Xd Yh` after 24 hours, so long gaps between contractions are readable at a glance.
- **Always-visible sections**: Pattern Assessment, Trend Analysis, and Hospital Advisor sections now always appear with a placeholder message when there isn't enough data, so you can see and reorder all sections from the start.
- **Untimed contractions in charts**: Wave chart shows untimed contractions as dashed markers with diamond tips instead of bell curves. History table shows "Untimed" in the duration column.
- Untimed contractions are excluded from duration-based stats (average duration, 5-1-1 duration check, stage estimation) but included in interval and count calculations.

### Fixed
- Location picker disappearing when intensity was set before location (both pickers now stay visible until both are rated).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Post-contraction picker bug: setting intensity before location caused location picker to vanish on re-render. Condition now checks both fields.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Untimed contraction logging (initial version, later redesigned in 0.1.6).
- Smart rest timer formatting.
- Always-visible sections with placeholders.
- Untimed filtering in duration stats and Braxton Hicks assessment.
